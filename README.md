# gobatty-drupal7

Created for Hack Upstate XI!

Uses Drupal 7, HTML5 (audio), media_recorder module, and a DS custom code field.  (Functionality bundled and codified using Features.)

D7 because media_recorder hasn't been ported to D8 -- and let's be honest, the chances that something will _just work_ are a whole heck of a lot better in D7.  (Oh yes I did.)
